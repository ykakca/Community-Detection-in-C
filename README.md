Written in C, this program aims to detect the different communities (cliques) formed in a network (an undirected graph).
The algorithm uses the same intuition Girvan-Newman algorithm uses, with a manually written BFS based approach.
The graphs are read from .txt files written in a specific format to make the process of creating graphs easier, and adjacency matrix approach is preferred over adjacency list approach.
Some changes will be made in the near future (implementing a more iteration-based approach etc).
